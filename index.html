            <p>I live in Valley Center California, 30 miles North East of San Diego, about 20 miles from the Coast.I have been married to my beautiful wife for 35 years and I celebrated my 45th anniversary at my job on June 10th. I will be graduating from BYUI on July 25, 2024.  I will be receiving my Bachelors degree in Applied Business Management.  My hobbies are Off-Roading in my Polaris Razor Turbo S and my Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, restoring old cars, ham radio, spending time with my wife traveling and taking care of our property, and spending time with my family.  I also enjoy going to the temple and doing family history. I currently serve as a counselor in the Bishopric.</p>

                <p>California has more people than any other state in the United States. If California was a separate country, it would have the sixth largest economy in the world. California is probably the state with the most ethnic groups. It also has many different geographic features ‚Äì mountains, deserts, and coasts.</p>
